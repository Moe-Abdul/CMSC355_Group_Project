Mental Health Support App

Our Mental Health Support App is built to make mental health care more accessible and personal. It will connect users with local mental health resources based on their location, making it easier to find therapists, support groups, and other nearby services. For people who prefer online care, the app will also offer options for virtual therapy sessions, providing the flexibility to speak with a professional from where they feel the most comfortable. Along with professional support, the app will encourage daily mood tracking and journaling, giving the users a place to reflect on their feelings and monitor their emotional well being. The goal is to provide thoughtful and personalized suggestions that help users feel more in tune with their mental health.
